### Introduction to NLTK 

### 1. What is NLTK ❓

 NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a suite that contains libraries and programs for statistical language processing. 
 It is one of the most powerful NLP libraries, which contains packages to make machines understand human language and reply to it with an appropriate response.
   
 It helps practitioners by providing easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 lexical and corpora resources, with text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, tagging, stemming, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries. The corpora of data consist of data from various applications over the internet; for text analytics, we can get data. By analyzing tweets on Twitter, we can find trending news and people’s reactions to a particular event. Amazon can understand user feedback or review on the specific product. 
 BookMyShow can discover people’s reviews about the movie, which can be both positive or negative. Youtube can also analyze and understand people’s viewpoints on a video.
   
  ### Getting started with NLTK
  Download NLTK –  you can download NLTK with nltk.download()
  ### Import NLTK
  You can import NLTK directly using import.

  Some simple operations with NLTK
  ### Tokenizing 
  Tokenizing means breaking down large words or sentences into smaller length form, which helps to clean the data for processing and classification.

  ### Tokenize words
  To tokenize words means to break down a sentence into an array of words.

  ### Tokenize sentences
  To tokenize sentences is to break down long sentences into parts that differ by breakpoints.

  ### Part of speech (POS)
  A part-of-speech tagger(POS-tagger) generally processes word-sequences; for each word, it attaches a part of speech. 
  The tokenization concept should be used to achieve this. (Tokenization is the process of dividing the quantity of text into smaller pieces called tokens.)
