# Data Preprocessing in Machine Learning
  Now-a-day mostly everything depends upon the Data and when that data is converted into information it leads to major changes and profit for the community.
  But what if the data gathered itself is not proper for the Analysis?
  That is when need for Data preprocessing arises.
  Machine learning algorithms are data-hungry. But there’s a catch. They need data in a specific format.
  Data preprocessing is the most important phase of a Machine Learning project.
 
## Need for Data Preprocessing?
  Collecting data from number of sources results in out-of-range values, impossible data combination, missing values, etc. Analyzing this kind of data that has not been prepared     properly for analysis can lead to misleading results. For achieving better results from the applied model in Machine Learning projects the format of the data has to be in a       proper manner.If there is much irrelevant and redundant information present or noisy and unreliable data, then knowledge discovery during   the training phase is more difficult.   The product of data preprocessing is the final training set. It also helps to select the most efficient model in Machine Learning.

  
## What is Data Preprocessing and steps involved in it?
  The process of cleaning raw data for it to be used for machine learning activities and analysis is known as data pre-processing. It’s the first and foremost step while doing a     machine learning project. Data preprocessing bascially helps us to get rid of the issues(missing values, outliers, null vlaues, etc) that can affect our analysis.
  
  ### Steps involved in data preprocessing:
  #### 1. Data Collection
     Data collection is the stage when we collect data from various sources. Data might be laying across several storages or several servers and we need to get all that data            collected in one single location for the ease of access.
