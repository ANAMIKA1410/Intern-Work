# **INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER VISION AND BASIC FUNCTIONS OF OPENCV**

## **WHAT IS COMPUTER VISION ?**

***Computer vision*** is a field of study which enables computers to replicate the human visual system. Itâ€™s a subset of artificial intelligence which collects information from digital images or videos and processes them to define the attributes.

The entire process involves image acquiring, screening, analysing, identifying and extracting information. This extensive processing helps computers to understand any visual content and act on it accordingly. 

Computer vision projects translate digital visual content into explicit descriptions to gather multi-dimensional data. This data is then turned into computer-readable language to aid the decision-making process. The main objective of this branch of artificial intelligence is to teach machines to collect information from pixels.
