# **INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER VISION AND BASIC FUNCTIONS OF OPENCV**

## **WHAT IS COMPUTER VISION ?**

**Computer vision** is a field of study which enables computers to replicate the human visual system. It’s a subset of artificial intelligence which collects information from digital images or videos and processes them to define the attributes.

The entire process involves image acquiring, screening, analysing, identifying and extracting information. This extensive processing helps computers to understand any visual content and act on it accordingly. 

Computer vision projects translate digital visual content into explicit descriptions to gather multi-dimensional data. This data is then turned into computer-readable language to aid the decision-making process. The main objective of this branch of artificial intelligence is to teach machines to collect information from pixels.

## **EXAMPLES OF COMPUTER VISION AND ALGORITHMS**

**Automatic cars** aim at reducing the need for human intervention while driving, through various AI systems. Computer vision is part of such a system which focuses on imitating the logics behind human vision to help the machines take data-based decisions.

CV systems will scan live objects and categorise them, based on which the car will keep running or make a stop. If the car comes across an obstacle or a traffic light, it will analyse the image, create a 3D version of it, consider the features and decide on an action- all within a second.

## **HOW DOES COMPUTER VISION WORK?**

Computer Vision primarily relies on pattern recognition techniques to self-train and understand visual data. The wide availability of data and the willingness of companies to share them has made it possible for deep learning experts to use this data to make the process more accurate and fast. 

While machine learning algorithms were previously used for computer vision applications, now deep learning methods have evolved as a better solution for this domain. For instance, machine learning techniques require a humongous amount of data and active human monitoring in the initial phase monitoring to ensure that the results are as accurate as possible.

Deep learning on the other hand, relies on neural networks, and uses examples for problem solving. It self-learns by using labeled data to recognise common patterns in the examples.

## **WHY IS COMPUTER VISION IMPORTANT?**

Apart from automating a lot of functions, computer vision also ensures moderation and monitoring of online visual content. One of the main tasks involved in online content curation is indexing. Since the content available on the internet is mainly of two types, namely text, visual, and audio categorisation becomes easy.

Computer vision uses algorithms to read and index images. Popular search engines like Google and Youtube use computer vision to scan through images and videos to approve them for featuring. By way of doing so, they not only provide users with relevant content but also protect against online abuse and “toxicity”.

## **ORIGIN OF COMPUTER VISION**

Computer vision is not a new concept; in fact, it dates back to the 1960s. It all started with an MIT project -“Summer Vision Project” which analysed scenes to identify objects. David Marr, the celebrated neuroscientist, laid down the building blocks of computer vision, taking a cue from the functions of the cerebellum, hippocampus, and cortex of human perception. He has been dubbed the father of computer vision since, and the field has evolved to include much more complicated functionalities.

Here are some examples of basic functions while writing an opencv code in Python:
1. `img = cv2.imread('click.jpeg')` --> used to import the image from current directory.

2. `cv2.imshow('logo',img)` --> used to view the image as an output.

3. `cv2.imwrite('click_2.jpeg',img)` --> used to save the image to the output durectory.
